# SpinningDonut
This is my attempt to understand the logic and algorithm behind the spinning donut created by Andy Sloane - https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html
Thanks to https://github.com/codegiovanni for their python implementation https://github.com/codegiovanni/Donut_2.0 
I am trying to make the code a bit easier to understand and add more functionality to create better and richer graphics.
